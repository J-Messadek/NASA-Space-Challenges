    "abstract": "After a 16-year hiatus, Russia has resumed its program of biomedical research in space, with the successful 30-day flight of the Bion-M 1 biosatellite (April 19–May 19, 2013). The principal species for biomedical research in this project was the mouse. This paper presents an overview of the scientific goals, the experimental design and the mouse training/selection program. The aim of mice experiments in the Bion-M 1 project was to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms, underlying the adaptation of key physiological systems to long-term exposure in microgravity. The studies with mice combined in vivo measurements, both in flight and post-flight (including continuous blood pressure measurement), with extensive in vitro studies carried out shortly after return of the mice and in the end of recovery study. Male C57/BL6 mice group housed in space habitats were flown aboard the Bion-M 1 biosatellite, or remained on ground in the control experiment that replicated environmental and housing conditions in the spacecraft. Vivarium control groups were used to account for housing effects and possible seasonal differences. Mice training included the co-adaptation in housing groups and mice adaptation to paste food diet. The measures taken to co-adapt aggressive male mice in housing groups and the peculiarities of “space” paste food are described. The training program for mice designated for in vivo studies was broader and included behavioral/functional test battery and continuous behavioral measurements in the home-cage. The results of the preliminary tests were used for the selection of homogenous groups. After the flight, mice were in good condition for biomedical studies and displayed signs of pronounced disadaptation to Earth's gravity. The outcomes of the training program for the mice welfare are discussed. We conclude that our training program was effective and that male mice can be successfully employed in space biomedical research.",

    "summary": "This paper details the training and selection program for male C57/BL6 mice aboard the 30-day Bion-M 1 biosatellite mission (April 19–May 19, 2013), which aimed to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms of physiological adaptation to long-term microgravity. The program included co-adaptation of aggressive male mice in housing groups and adaptation to a paste food diet, with a broader battery of behavioral/functional tests for in vivo study subjects to ensure homogenous groups. The training program proved effective, yielding mice in good condition for post-flight biomedical studies and showing pronounced disadaptation to Earth's gravity, concluding that male mice are suitable for space biomedical research.",
    "impact": "This publication represents a significant contribution to space biology by detailing successful protocols for preparing animal models for microgravity research, marking Russia's resumption of biomedical space research after a 16-year hiatus. Scientifically, it advances methodology for ensuring animal welfare and data reliability in space experiments, which is crucial for understanding physiological adaptation and disadaptation at cellular and molecular levels. Practically, the described training and selection programs can inform future space missions utilizing animal models, thereby supporting research on astronaut health, development of countermeasures, and broader insights into biological responses to extreme environments.",
